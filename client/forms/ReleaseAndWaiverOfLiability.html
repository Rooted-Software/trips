                    I desire to travel to one or more foreign countries in
                    cooperation with Trash Mountain Project (hereinafter “TMP”).
                    I understand that TMP is a non-profit charitable organization
                    and that TMP is organizing a mission trip and associated activities and it is my desire, in recognition of this valuable service to me, that TMP and its officers, agents, employees, representatives, volunteers, and directors (the “Released Parties”) have no legal exposure for possible injury or damages I sustain while on any mission trip or while participating in any activities associated with TMP. Therefore, I covenant and agree as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    In consideration for receiving permission to participate
                    in activities and/or mission trip sponsored by, organized
                    by or affiliated with TMP, I hereby release, waive,
                    discharge, covenant not to sue, and agree to hold
                    harmless for any and all purposes TMP, its officers,
                    directors, employees, volunteers and agents from any and
                    all liabilities, claims, demands, injuries (including death),
                    or damages, including court costs and attorneys fees and expenses,
                    that may be sustained or incurred by me while
                    participating in such activities or mission trips, while
                    traveling to and from the activity and mission trip destination,
                    or while on premises owned or leased by TMP, including
                    injuries sustained as a result of the sole, joint, or
                    concurrent negligence, negligence per se, statutory fault,
                    or strict liability of TMP. I understand this waiver does
                    not apply to injuries caused by intentional or grossly
                    negligent conduct of TMP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mission of TMP is to develop Christ-centered
                    environments for children and families living in trash
                    dump communities worldwide. TMP seeks to share the
                    despair and hopelessness of life in the dump through
                    the avenue of documentary film and encouraging individuals,
                    churches and organizations to respond with the sacrificial
                    love of Jesus Christ. I understand and agree with this
                    mission statement. I am willing to be led by the authority
                    of TMP Staff and its representatives and will abide by
                    the rules and policies of Trash Mountain Project, as well
                    as any and all instructions or directions given to me by
                    TMP representatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I understand that travel, particularly for mission
                    purposes, may involve significant risks and that travel
                    to some areas of the world involves greater health and
                    safety risks than general international travel. My
                    signature on this RELEASE, and my participation in any
                    such activity associated with the mission trip indicates
                    that I have to my full satisfaction obtained all
                    information necessary for me to assess the risk and to
                    willingly participate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I understand that secondary insurance, including
                    emergency medical evacuation insurance, may be purchased
                    by TMP for volunteer trip participants serving with TMP
                    on an international mission trip, but the purchase of
                    such insurance is not mandatory and is the sole discretion
                    of TMP. I understand that the coverage, if purchased by
                    TMP, provides a basic level of protection and is not
                    intended to replace any personal insurance that I may have.
                    I also understand that TMP is not required to and may not
                    maintain any insurance policy covering any circumstance
                    arising from my participation in this activity or any
                    event related to that participation. As such, I am aware
                    that I should review my personal insurance coverage as it
                    relates to any mission trip and/or activity associated
                    with an international mission trip. I understand that if
                    I do not have stateside medical insurance, TMP can't buy
                    travel insurance for me and I understand any medical
                    expenses incurred will be my responsibility to pay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I understand that TMP cannot be expected to control all
                    of the risks articulated in this form and TMP may need to
                    respond to accidents and potential emergency situations.
                    Therefore, I hereby give my consent for any medical
                    treatment that may be required, as determined by a medical
                    professional at a medical facility and/or TMP representatives,
                    if I am unable to provide such consent myself during my
                    participation in activities and/or mission trips affiliated
                    with TMP, with the understanding that all costs of any
                    medical treatment provided to me will be my responsibility.
                    I agree to reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless TMP
                    for any costs incurred to provide me with medical treatment,
                    even if TMP has signed hospital documentation promising to
                    pay for treatment due to my inability to sign such documentation.
                    I further agree to release, waive, discharge, covenant
                    not to sue, and agree to hold harmless for any and all
                    purposes, TMP from any and all liabilities, claims,
                    demands, injuries (including death), or damages, including
                    court costs and attorney’s fees and expenses, that may
                    be incurred by me while receiving medical care or in
                    deciding to seek medical care, including while traveling
                    to and from a medical care facility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    International acts of terrorism, violence and kidnapping
                    are a tragic part of current reality. I agree with TMP
                    that governments, organizations, and individuals have a
                    common interest in not giving in to terrorist demands.
                    I agree with TMP that concessions, whenever made, only
                    encourage further attacks and put additional people at
                    risk. I understand that in the event that I am held as
                    hostage or a victim of kidnapping, TMP will use every
                    legitimate means to secure my release but will not make
                    any concessions to terrorists nor negotiate payment of
                    ransom for my release.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each Releasing Party agrees that the foregoing release,
                    waiver, and indemnity agreement is intended to be as broad
                    and inclusive as is permitted by the law of the State
                    of Kansas and that if any portion of this release, waiver,
                    and indemnity agreement is held invalid, the balance will,
                    notwithstanding, continue in full legal force and effect.
                    I agree that this release and waiver of liability shall be
                    governed by Kansas law and applicable laws of the United
                    States. The venue for resolving such disputes shall be
                    Topeka, KS.
