                <p>As a Trash Mountain Project mission team member, you are expected to behave in such a way that represents Christ, TMP and the local ministries with which we partner. Agreeing to serve on a TMP team means that you will conduct yourself according to the highest standards of integrity and morality, adhering to the policies of TMP mission teams. Failure to follow these guidelines will result in disciplinary action, including possible dismissal from the field at your own expense.
                    The following guidelines are meant to promote the safety and effectiveness of our mission.
                    As a TMP team member you are expected to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1. Serve as an ambassador of Jesus Christ and adopt that attitude when interacting with fellow team members and the people you meet during the trip.</li>

                    <li>2. Accept and submit to the leadership and authority of the team leader(s) and abide by his or her decisions and instructions on this mission trip.</li>

                    <li>3. Refrain from using tobacco, alcoholic beverages or illegal drugs as well as entering a casino at any time during the mission trip. (Christians in countries TMP travels to do not partake of these things, so neither will we.)</li>

                    <li>4. Come home the way you left. This includes body piercing, tattoos, etc.</li>

                    <li>5. Adhere to the dress code established for your trip.</li>

                    <li>6. Make sure the group leader knows where you are at all times. You should NEVER wander off alone while on the mission field.</li>

                    <li>7. Understand that mission trips can be difficult. Adopt a flexible attitude, as plans will most likely change.</li>

                    <li>8. Avoid seeking out romantic relationships with a team member, team leader, oversees worker or national you might meet on the trip. Do not spend time alone with a member of the opposite sex in a private setting or engage in any activity that could be construed as romantic interest or otherwise inappropriate behavior.</li>

                    <li>9. Refrain from giving gifts of any sort. Although the intent of the giver is good, the results after we leave can cause problems for our host and jealousy amongst the nationals who did not receive such gifts. If you feel compelled to give a gift to someone you have met, consult first with the team leader before you give a gift.</li>

                    <li>10. Never give your address or phone number to anyone. For your protection, we strongly advise not giving out full name or information that could enable someone to find you on Facebook.</li>

                    <li>11. Refrain from any other behavior or activity that would hinder your ministry, your teamâ€™s ministry or the future of the local ministry.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I confirm the following: I read, understand and agree to the above code of conduct. I understand and agree that in the event that my behavior jeopardizes the success of the trip, my services with the mission shall end, and I will be sent home immediately at my own expense.</p>
