# Trips
Track trip participants forms and fundraising

This app works in concert with both <a href="https://donortools.com">DonorTools</a> and <a href="http://c316.github.io/give/">Give</a>.
The end result is a way for your trip participants to fundraise for their trips as well as complete forms and upload their passport photo. And this all ties back to the Give app for donations and to DonorTools for tracking those donations.
